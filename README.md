# Research Proposal: Neurodiversity and AI

## Background

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important tool in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and education. However, AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases and discrimination, particularly against neurodivergent individuals. Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in neurological functioning, including conditions such as autism, dyslexia, and ADHD. AI systems can be trained on biased data, leading to inaccurate and discriminatory outcomes. It is essential to address these issues to ensure fair and equitable use of AI.

## Research Question

How can AI systems be designed and developed to address biases and discrimination against neurodivergent individuals?

## Objectives

The objectives of this research proposal are:

1. To investigate the impact of bias and discrimination in AI systems on neurodivergent individuals.
2. To explore the potential of neurodiversity-informed design in developing fair and equitable AI systems.
3. To identify best practices for addressing bias and discrimination in AI systems.
4. To propose potential applications of neurodiversity-informed design in AI systems.

## Methodology

The proposed research will use a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data. The research will be divided into two phases:

### Phase 1: Literature Review

The first phase will involve conducting a comprehensive literature review of existing research on bias and discrimination in AI systems, and neurodiversity-informed design. This will involve a systematic search of academic databases, journals, and books. The review will aim to identify the current state of research in the field, and identify any gaps in the literature.

### Phase 2: Data Collection and Analysis

The second phase will involve collecting and analyzing primary data. The research will employ two primary methods of data collection:

1. Surveys: The research will conduct surveys with neurodivergent individuals, AI developers, and experts in the field. The surveys will aim to gather insights into the impact of bias and discrimination in AI systems on neurodivergent individuals, and explore potential solutions.
2. Case Studies: The research will conduct case studies of AI systems that have successfully addressed biases and discrimination against neurodivergent individuals. The case studies will investigate the design principles and strategies employed by these systems.

The data collected from the surveys and case studies will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The analysis will identify common themes and patterns in the data, and draw conclusions based on the findings.

## Expected Outcome

The research proposal is expected to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on addressing bias and discrimination in AI systems, particularly against neurodivergent individuals. The findings of the research will provide insights into the impact of biased AI systems on neurodivergent individuals and explore potential solutions. The research will identify best practices for designing fair and equitable AI systems and propose potential applications of neurodiversity-informed design in AI systems.

## Timeline

The proposed research will take approximately 12 months to complete. The timeline for the research is as follows:

- Phase 1: Literature Review: 3 months
- Phase 2: Data Collection and Analysis: 6 months
- Report Writing and Submission: 3 months

## Conclusion

The proposed research will investigate the impact of bias and discrimination in AI systems on neurodivergent individuals and explore potential solutions. The research will employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data, and identify best practices for designing fair and equitable AI systems. The findings of the research will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on addressing bias and discrimination in AI systems and pave the way for fair and inclusive use of AI.
